# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

### Added — direct shell mode (operator feedback)

- `!<command>` runs a shell command directly: sandboxed through the
  same shell_exec path (timeout, output cap, exit-status surfacing) but
  with no approval prompt (the user typed it). Command and output are
  injected into the model's context, verified live (the model recalls
  the output on the next turn). Works in the TUI and the plain REPL

### Added — bottom-pinned layout (ADR-0003, operator feedback)

- The input box and status line pin to the window bottom like current
  Claude Code, still without alt-screen: the TUI clears the screen once
  at startup, prints the banner through a physical-line counter, and
  pads the view top by the remaining height. Padding floors at zero
  when the conversation fills the screen; shrink-clears reset the count

### Changed — single status line (operator feedback)

- The always-on key-hint line is gone; key bindings moved into /help.
  The input block is now "input box + one status line", matching the
  status-bar reading of the footer

### Added — persistent footer (operator feedback)

- Footer line across all TUI phases: model name, context occupancy vs
  the model's input token limit (auto-detected via model metadata,
  overridable with `[model].context_window`), cumulative token
  consumption, and the ~-abbreviated project directory

### Fixed

- MCP kill-and-respawn race: a stale read loop no longer closes the
  successor incarnation's pending calls ("server exited during
  initialize" right after a timeout)

### Changed — TUI readability (operator feedback)

- Errors stand out: unknown /commands and turn failures render bold red
  with a `✗` marker instead of blending into dim meta text
- Theme-safe colors: accents use the ANSI-16 palette (follows the
  terminal theme); dim text (footer/hints) uses a background-aware
  256-palette mid-gray (245 on dark / 240 on light) — both the Faint
  attribute and ANSI color 8 render near-invisible on real themes
- New `[tui].theme` config: auto (default) / dark / light / plain —
  plain disables all styling for terminal themes that fight any colors

### Added — interactive TUI (ADR-0002)

- Bubble Tea inline TUI: completed conversation flushes to native
  scrollback; the managed live region carries streaming text, a
  spinner/status line, and the input box. Textarea input with
  paste-flagged newlines (a paste can never submit), Ctrl+J manual
  newline, ↑↓ history behind an explicit navigation-state flag, approval
  dialog (y/n/a) answering the gate over a channel, glamour Markdown
  rendering per segment (text/tool-event order preserved). Non-TTY use
  falls back to the plain line REPL; `-p` unchanged. Verified through a
  pty-driven E2E (expect) against live Vertex AI

### Added — development Phase 2 (Integration)

- Stdio MCP client with Claude Code `.mcp.json` compatibility (stdio
  entries, `${VAR}` expansion); tools register as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`,
  always approval-gated; kill-and-lazy-respawn on timeout (MCP has no
  cancel); verified live against tor-exit-lookup with gemini-3.7-flash
- mcp-guardian opt-in documented as a plain `.mcp.json` entry (guardian is
  itself a stdio MCP server — no gem-agent-side wiring needed)
- AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md injection into the system prompt (32KB/file cap),
  verified live (injected rule observed in responses)
- Nonce-tag isolation of tool output via nlk/guard — fresh tag per LLM
  call, expanded into the system prompt and wrapped at send time
- One-shot mode `-p` (single turn, stdout answer, mutating tools denied
  with a visible reason, pipe-friendly)
- Exponential backoff (nlk/backoff) for 429/5xx stream starts, retrying
  only before any chunk is consumed

### Added — development Phase 1 (Core)

- Interactive REPL with a streaming Vertex AI Gemini agent loop; Gemini 3
  thought-signature capture/replay (ported from shell-agent-v2 ADR-0009,
  verified live against gemini-3-flash-preview via the global endpoint)
- Built-in tools (`list_files` / `read_file` / `write_file` / `edit_file` /
  `shell_exec`) with project-dir confinement including symlink-escape checks,
  output caps, and non-zero exit status / timeout surfacing
- MITL approval gate (y/n/a) with session-scoped allowlist, failing closed
- macOS sandbox-exec SBPL profile generation for shell_exec (deny file-write*
  outside project + scratch dirs; real Seatbelt enforcement test)
- Paste-safe REPL input (multi-line paste aggregates into one input)
- Strict-decode TOML config with flags > `GEMAGENT_*` > `GOOGLE_CLOUD_*` >
  file > defaults precedence
- JSONL session logging under `~/.local/state/gem-agent/sessions/`

### Fixed

- Backend errors are no longer misreported as "(interrupted)"
  (signal.NotifyContext stop() ordering bug, found in live smoke testing)

### Added — scaffold

- Project scaffold (CONVENTIONS.md Phase 2): Go module, cobra root command
  answering `--version` (with a pinning test), Makefile (`dist/` output,
  darwin-arm64 only, codesign/notarize wiring), org-standard `.gitignore`,
  MIT LICENSE, bilingual docs structure
- RFP (`docs/ja/gem-agent-rfp.ja.md` / `docs/en/gem-agent-rfp.md`)
- ADR-0001: sandbox mechanism — sandbox-exec + MITL two-layer defense
